Version: 1.0

Current Functionality:
* popup controls activation/deactivation of extension.
* when the user tries to open a blacklisted site, it is automatically closed (existing blacklisted sites remain open until they are reloaded).
* block existing webpages without deleting them (redirects to block page)
    * when popup deactived, returns websites to original url

To Do:
* add update blocked sites functionality
    * not meant to persist between browser/extension reloads. i want a base block list.
